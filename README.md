## About The Project 👀

Markus needs a web solution for the sales team to avoid creating budgets on paper. They will be able to select bike parts, and the rules and restrictions will be displayed on the screen.

### Lib folder
Data Parsing in lib Folder
The lib folder serves as the data parser for this project. However, the data fetching functionality has not been implemented yet. To retrieve the data, it needs to be connected to a backend, which could be any API, such as a custom API, Google Drive API, Airtable, or Contentful. Currently, the data is mocked for testing purposes, and integration with an actual backend is needed to pull real data.
